This project uses C to find the biggest empty square in a random map with obstacles. We are currently using dynamic programming to search for the box.

This was our last project during the piscine at 42. With my partner Claudia, we spent two days whiteboarding and coding this out. Though our project was mostly functional, we are determined to make it fully functional. :)
